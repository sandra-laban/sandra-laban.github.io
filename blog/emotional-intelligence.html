          <h3>What is Emotional intelligence?</h3>
          <p>
            Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognize your emotions,
            understand what they're telling you, and realize how your emotions
            affect people around you. It also involves your perception of
            others: when you understand how they feel, this allows you to manage
            relationships more effectively.
          </p>
          <h4>
            The main characteristics of emotional intelligence are sometimes
            reduced to three central ideas - the 3 C's:
          </h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Consciousness</b> - being mindful of your emotions, being
              self-aware so you can identify how your emotions impact others.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Compassion</b> - being empathetic towards others. Having the
              ability to identify with and understand the wants, needs, and
              viewpoints of those around you.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Connectedness</b> - the ability to get on with others. It's
              usually easy to talk to and like people with good social skills,
              another sign of high emotional intelligence.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>What's the difference between IQ and EQ?</h3>
          <p>
            Your IQ usually refers to your intellectual ability. Some of the
            most common elements of your IQ include your ability to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>use logic to solve problems</li>
            <li>plan and strategize</li>
            <li>understand abstract ideas</li>
            <li>learn and adapt to change</li>
            <li>grasp and use language</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Your emotional quotient (EQ) generally refers to your ability to
            sense emotion in yourself and in other people. It also refers to how
            you use that awareness to guide your behavior. In general, if you
            have a high EQ, you may find it easier to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>identify emotions in yourself and others</li>
            <li>empathize with other people</li>
            <li>adapt your feelings and behavior to different situations</li>
            <li>control your impulses</li>
            <li>withstand temptations and delay gratification</li>
            <li>resolve conflicts with others</li>
            <li>communicate effectively</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            IQ tests measure your ability to solve problems, use logic, and
            grasp or communicate complex ideas.
          </p>

          <p>
            EQ tests measure your ability to recognize emotion in yourself and
            others, and to use that awareness to guide your decisions.
          </p>

          <h3>Why is EQ important?</h3>
          <p>
            Although "regular" intelligence is important to success in life,
            emotional intelligence is key to relating well to others and
            achieving your goals. Many people believe that it is at least as
            important as regular intelligence, and many companies now use
            emotional intelligence testing to hire new staff.
          </p>
          <p>
            Emotional intelligence is an awareness of your actions and feelings
            - and how they affect those around you. It also means that you value
            others, listen to their wants and needs, and are able to empathize
            or identify with them on many different levels.
