        <h1 class="post-title">Learning Plan</h1>
        <h2 class="post-subtitle">Bootcamp learning plan</h2>
        <p>28 September 2023</p>
        <div class="post-block">
          <h3>The long term goal</h3>
          <p>
            My plan is to level up my technical skills and become a Front-End
            Developer specialist. My goal is to become a senior in this field,
            work with product teams on bigger projects and move from corporate
            websites.
          </p>
          <h3>Strengths and limitations at Bootcamp</h3>
          <p>
            I would say that I can rush through things and focus more on
            efficiency instead of quality. As well as I can go to other end and
            get to perfectionist mode. â€¨Also, the technical part of the learning
            may be the biggest challenge as I'm not always confident in my
            abilities to grasp complex concepts and navigate through new
            systems.
          </p>
          <h3>Non-technical challenge at Bootcamp</h3>
          <p>
            The non-technical challenge will be to stay on top of the material
            and not rush through things. Collaborating on group projects may
            also be challenging because it will be online, so communication
            could be slower.
          </p>
          <h3>Human skills I would like to develop at Bootcomp</h3>
          <p>
            Definitely to develop more efficient communication, as well as
            giving and receiving constructive feedback.
          </p>
          <h3>Expectations from the Bootcamp team</h3>
          <p>
            I hope the bootcamp team can provide help, guidance, engagement and
            a friendly atmosphere as I learn. I want to gain more confidence and
            knowledge, so I can reach my full potential during this journey.
          </p>

          <h3>Expectations of myself on Bootcamp</h3>
          <p>
            If I get stuck with finding solution by my self I will reach out to
            peers or bootcamp team. I aim to be fully engaged with the bootcamp
            by following rules, being on time, being prepared, and completing
            objectives on time.

        <h2 class="post-subtitle">Foundations learning plan</h2>
        <p>9 September 2023</p>
        <div class="post-block">
          <h3>The long term goal</h3>
          <p>
            Well, so far I was working as web developer/designer in the
            marketing team, and it can be a bit challenging at times. I often
            find myself stuck on technical stuff, and there aren't many
            colleagues around who can help me out. So, my plan is to level up my
            technical skills and become a Front-End Developer specialist. I want
            to be part of a bigger team with more developers where we can all
            learn from each other. My dream down the road is to become a senior
            in this field. And, looking even further ahead, I see myself
            starting a company with my husband - a startup adventure.
          </p>
          <h3>Strengths and limitations</h3>
          <p>
            <b>Strengths:</b> Whether it's troubleshooting project issues,
            handling real-life challenges, or strategizing during a game like
            chess, I'm all in. Problem-solving is something I truly enjoy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also,I'm one persistent cookie. When I decide to learn something, I
            don't give up easily. That determination of mine keeps me going,
            even when things get tough. So, count on me to stick with it and see
            things through.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Limitations:</b> Sometimes, it's tough for me to ask for help or
            step out of my comfort zone. I tend to overthink things, and I have
            this perfectionist streak in me.
          </p>
          <p>
            When it comes to complex problems, it takes me a little extra time
            to really wrap my head around them. I might need a few more
            explanations to fully understand things. But here's the upside: once
            I do grasp it, I'm all in and ready to tackle the challenge
            effectively. That's just how I roll!
          </p>
          <h3>Core human skills</h3>
          <p>
            Besides all the technical stuff, I'm really looking to grow in some
            core human skills. One biggie for me is better communication. I'm
            kind of an introvert, so socialising and expressing myself clearly
            can be a bit of a challenge. I want to get better at connecting with
            others and making my ideas heard. So, improving my communication and
            interaction skills is high on my list while I'm at Dev Academy.
          </p>
          <h3>Managing workload</h3>
          <p>
            I'm going to work for about 8 hours every day. I'll take a nice
            one-hour break for lunch. And in between, I'll have short breaks to
            make some coffee and stretch my legs. That way, I can stay
            productive without feeling too tired.I'll keep my evenings free to
            spend time with my kids and husband. If I need to, I can stay up
            late to catch up on work.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to maintain a positive and stress-free mindset, I'll take
            little breaks from the computer when I need to. Maybe go for a walk
            or have a chat with a friend. I'll stick with my yoga practice
            because it really helps me feel relaxed and centered. So, staying
            positive and stress-free should be doable.
          </p>

          <h3>Seeking help commitment</h3>
          <p>
            I will ask for help from my cohort members if I can't resolve an
            issue on my own within 30 minutes. I'll give it a good try, but if
            I'm still stuck after that time, I will try my best not to hesitate
            to reach out to the Dev Academy facilitators for assistance. I won't
            stay stuck for too long and will keep the learning process moving
            smoothly. We're in this together, right?
          </p>
          <h3>Expectations from the Facilitation team</h3>
          <p>
            What I'm really hoping for from the Facilitation team is that
            they'll be patient and understanding. I mean, if I need something
            explained, even if it takes them repeating it five times or breaking
            it down like they're explaining to a five-year-old, that's perfectly
            fine with me. Basically, I just want them to be there to help me
            understand and not feel shy about asking for clarification.
          </p>
          <h3>Commitments</h3>
          <p>
            I'm fortunate to have wonderful support from my husband, who takes
            care of our children's activities and maintains our home seamlessly.
            This support allows me to fully concentrate on my course; however,
            there may be occasions when I'll need to step in for school pick-ups
            or drop-offs. I've planned to set aside dedicated time for my yoga
            practice in the evenings and quality time with family and friends on
            weekends.
