        <h2 class="post-subtitle">
          Until recently, scientists believed our brains stayed the same after
          childhood, but that's not true. They've discovered "neuroplasticity,"
          which means our brains can change throughout our lives.

          <h3>How neuroplasticity works?</h3>
          <p>
            Think of your brain like a dynamic power grid with billions of
            pathways. Some are well-traveled, like our habits. When we use these
            paths, they get stronger. But if we start thinking differently or
            doing new things, we create new pathways. Over time, these new ways
            become natural, and the old ones weaken.
          </p>
          <p>
            We can all learn and change by rewiring our brains. If you've ever
            broken a bad habit or changed your thinking, you've experienced
            neuroplasticity. With focused attention on what you want to change,
            you can rewire your brain. Your brain is way more adaptable than we
            once thought!
          </p>
          <h3>
            Engaging with the principles of neuroplasticity and increase it for
            your benefit:
          </h3>
          <p>
            We can all learn and change by rewiring our brains. If you've ever

          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Repetition, time and practice:</b> Consistently practicing the
              skill or behavior you want to improve is key.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Action and experience:</b> ALearning by doing and actively
              engaging in experiences fosters the creation of new neural
              connections.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Overcoming self-doubt:</b> Believe in your ability to change
              and silence the inner-critic that says you can't do it.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Nutritious diet:</b> Eating healthy foods rich in antioxidants,
              omega-3 fatty acids, and nutrients supports optimal brain
              function..
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Mindfulness:</b> Practices like meditation and mindfulness can
              enhance neuroplasticity by promoting stress reduction and focus.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Regular exercise:</b> Physical activity stimulates the release
              of chemicals that aid in brain cell growth and connectivity.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Gratitude:</b> Cultivating a sense of gratitude can positively
              impact brain function and overall well-being.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            By incorporating these principles and habits into your life, you can
            actively boost neuroplasticity and work towards personal growth and
            development.

          <h3>Growth mindset</h3>
          <p>
            Growth mindset is a research-based mental-framing process, studied
            for decades by Carol Dweck at Stanford, that can help you shift your
            perspective when you face challenging circumstances or struggle to
            succeed.
          </p>
          <p>These are the key elements of a growth mindset:</p>
          <h4>Intelligence can be developed</h4>
          <p>
            A fixed mindset might say intelligence is static. A growth mindset
            knows it is not; rather you can grow your brain's capacity to
            respond to complex problems. If at first you don't succeed, it
            doesn't mean that you don't belong or you can't learn. You're
            strengthening your ability to do the work every time you face a
            challenge.
          </p>
          <h4>Embrace challenges</h4>
          <p>
            The only way to have the experiences that help you truly grow is to
            embrace challenges. Don't take the easiest path. Take the one that
            will make you stronger and more prepared for the future.
          </p>
          <h4>Persist in the face of setbacks</h4>
          <p>
            Experiencing setbacks is like building a muscle. To physically grow
            a muscle, it must sustain micro-tears — essentially, damage — then
            it grows back stronger. You develop your muscles intellectually and
            emotionally, just as you do physically. Failures may be the
            experiences you learn from the most.
          </p>
          <h4>See effort as a path to mastery</h4>
          <p>
            Many people believe that if they have to work too hard, it's a sign
            that they don't belong. Those with a growth mindset recognize that
            working hard is how you get to success: hard work is the pathway,
            not a sign of a problem
          </p>
          <h4>Learn from criticism</h4>
          <p>
            Many people feel withered by criticism. It feels like a failure.
            People with a growth mindset are exhilarated by criticism: it's a
            chance to learn, grow and get better.
          </p>
          <h4>Find inspiration in the success of others</h4>
          <p>
            When you see someone else succeed, instead of comparing yourself
            negatively (“I'm not good enough”), use those who succeed as role
            models. Learn from their model to reach even higher levels of
            achievement.
