          <h3>JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS</h3>
          <p>
            HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are like the building blocks of a website.
            HTML structures the content, CSS makes it look good, and JavaScript
            adds the interactivity.
          </p>

          <p>
            The form on web page. HTML sets up the text the questions in the
            form, like name, age, and address. CSS then comes in to make
            everything look nice, adding style, colour, and formatting. It also
            creates those input boxes for users to fill out. Now, the magic
            happens with JavaScript. It makes a little pop-up box appear when
            someone submits the form, saying "Thanks for entering!" Plus, it can
            even grab the first name from the form and use it for a more
            personal touch.
          </p>
          <h3>Control flow and loops, arrays, and objects</h3>
          <p>
            Control flow statements are one of the most important features in
            JavaScript.Control flow statements are used to control the flow of
            execution in a program. They are used to make decisions, execute
            loops, and handle errors. There are three types of control flow
            statements in JavaScript: conditional statements, loops, and
            try/catch statements.
          </p>
          <h4>Conditional Statements</h4>
          <p>
            Conditional statements are used to execute different actions based
            on different conditions.
          </p>
          <p class="uppercase">If statement:</p>
          <img
            class="mb-5"
            src="../images/if-statment.png"
            alt="if statement"
          />
          <h4>Loops</h4>
          <p>
            Loops are used to execute a block of code multiple times. JavaScript
            supports different types of loops, including the for loop, while
            loop, and do-while loop. The for loop is the most commonly used loop
            in JavaScript. It is used to iterate over an array or execute a
            block of code a specific number of times.
          </p>
          <p class="uppercase">For loop:</p>
          <img class="mb-5" src="../images/for-loop.png" alt="for loop" />
          <h4>Objects</h4>
          <h5>When to use objects?</h5>
          <p>
            Objects are used to represent a “thing” in your code. That could be
            a person, a car, a building, a book, a character in a game —
            basically anything that is made up or can be defined by a set of
            characteristics. In objects, these characteristics are called
            <b>properties</b> that consist of a key and a value.
          </p>
          <img
            class="mb-5"
            src="../images/basic-object-syntax.png"
            alt="object key"
          />
          <img
            class="mb-5"
            src="../images/object-person.png"
            alt="object person"
          />
          <h5>Access, add, and remove items from objects</h5>
          <p>
            Properties in objects can be accessed, added, changed, and removed
            by using either dot or bracket notation. To get the value of the age
            key in our person object with both dot and bracket notation, we will
            write:
          </p>
          <img
            class="mb-5"
            src="../images/notation-object.png"
            alt="object notation"
          />
          <h4>Arrays</h4>
          <h5>When to use arrays?</h5>
          <p>
            We use arrays whenever we want to create and store a list of
            multiple items in a single variable. Arrays are especially useful
            when creating <b>ordered collections</b> where items in the
            collection can be accessed by their numerical position in the list.
            Arrays consist of strings, numbers, booleans, objects, or even other
            arrays.
          </p>
          <p>
            Arrays use 0 based indexing so the first item in an array has an
            index of 0, the second item an index of 1, and so on. For instance,
            let's say we wanted to access the third item ('apple') in the
            following array:
          </p>
          <img class="mb-5" src="../images/array.png" alt="array" />
          <p>To do that we will write:</p>
          <img class="mb-5" src="../images/array-2.png" alt="array item" />
          <p>
            Items can be added and removed from the beginning or end of an array
            using the push(), pop(), unshift(), and shift() methods:
          </p>

          <h3>Functions and why they are useful</h3>
          <p>
            Functions are one of the building blocks of JavaScript programming
            for creating web applications. You can think of functions as a way
            to group a set of instructions together and execute them as a single
            unit.
          </p>
          <p>
            A function is a block of code that performs a specific task.
            JavaScript functions are basically used to contain logic, making
            that code more reusable and easier to understand.
          </p>
          <p>
            The syntax for creating a function in JavaScript is quite simple.
            Functions can take input in the form of parameters and can return a
            value or output. Functions help you organise and structure your
            code. They also allow for code reuse and make it easier to
            understand and maintain large codebases.

          <h3>The DOM and DevTools</h3>
          <h4>DOM</h4>
          <p>
            The DOM is short for Document Object Model, acts as the bridge
            between HTML and CSS. It's a tree-like structure that represents a
            web page's structure and content, with each HTML element becoming a
            "node" in this tree. When we tweak CSS rules, the DOM ensures those
            changes get applied to the right elements. Think of the DOM as the
            behind-the-scenes hero that connects your HTML structure with your
            CSS styles, making sure your webpage looks and behaves just the way
            you want it to.
          </p>
          <h4>DevTools</h4>
          <p>
            DevTools is a set of web developer tools that are built directly
            into the Google Chrome browser. Chrome DevTools is a very useful
            tool for web app development. It allows you to work directly in the
            browser and see results in real time. You can use it to preview
            style changes, alter the HTML or help write your JavaScript code and
            do some debugging. There are so many ways to use Chrome DevTools.
            Here are same:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              viewing and changing a page's content (HTML) and styles (CSS)
            </li>
            <li>debugging JavaScript:</li>
            <li>viewing messages and running JavaScript in the console</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
