        <h1 class="post-title">Reflections</h1>
        <h2 class="post-subtitle">
          Reflection on my learning journey into the Core Skills covered in the
          Foundations curriculum
        </h2>
        <p>28 September 2023</p>
        <div class="post-block">
          <h3>
            Three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to
            the core learning
          </h3>
          <p>
            I learned that I used to thrive on the pressure of leaving tasks
            until the last minute, which was causing unnecessary stress. By
            changing my approach and tackling certain tasks earlier in the week,
            like finishing blogs on Mondays, I've realized that I can manage my
            time more efficiently and reduce stress levels. Recognized the value
            of seeking help when needed, and prioritized self-care without
            guilt.
          </p>
          <h3>
            What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
            and programming?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Values help us make choices, empathy lets us understand others and
            work well together in teams, and self-awareness makes us learn
            better and get better at coding
          </p>
          <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
          <p>
            What surprised me the most about the core learning was that it was
            part of the program in the first place. It felt like we were being
            encouraged to handle HR stuff on our own. Since I was already
            familiar with most of it, it turned out to be a great opportunity to
            test my self-awareness and practice self-talk when I wasn't fully
            confident in the subject.
          </p>
          <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
          <p>
            The most challenging part of the core learning, hands down, was the
            time it took to write those blogs. I was eager to dive into
            researching and learning about core skills and putting them into
            practice, but writing was a struggle. That's why I made a change and
            started tackling the blogs first so I could dedicate more time to
            the technical aspects
          </p>
          <h3>
            Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
            focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
          </h3>
          <p>
            I think it's because technical skills alone don't make a great
            developer. They want us to be well-rounded, not just coding
            machines. These core learning aspects, like communication, teamwork,
            and self-awareness, make us better collaborators, problem solvers,
            and professionals in the real world. So, it's about building not
            just coding skills but the whole package.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a
            waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise
            programming instead?
          </h3>
          <p>
            I've come to appreciate it. It's not a waste of time. These skills,
            like communication and self-awareness, actually make me a better
            person and better developer. Plus, they're super valuable in the
            real world.
