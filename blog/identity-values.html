        <h1 class="post-title">Identity, values, and strengths</h1>
        <h2 class="post-subtitle">
          This is reflection on my core personal values, and my strengths and
          limitations.
        </h2>
        <p>3 September 2023</p>
        <div class="post-block">
          <h3>
            Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss
            how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the
            decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
          </h3>
          <p>
            When I notice someone looking lost or confused, perhaps a tourist
            trying to find their way, I don't hesitate to approach them to offer
            assistance. It's a small act of empathy, connecting with the
            confusion they might be feeling and offering a helping hand.
            Reflecting on such moments, I feel warmth in knowing that a simple
            act of understanding can sometimes mean a lot to someone in need.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced
            your values and identity.
          </h3>
          <p>
            Growing up in Serbia taught me resilience and the importance of
            community. Moving to New Zealand enriched these values, introducing
            me to diverse cultures and a deep respect for nature. This blend of
            experiences has crafted my identity, encouraging empathy, harmony,
            and environmental consciousness in my daily life.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
            learning journey.
          </h3>
          <p>
            My adaptability, honed from living in various countries, will help
            me adjust to different learning settings and work well with diverse
            groups. My resilience, built through personal experiences, will aid
            in overcoming challenges with a positive mindset. Leveraging my
            empathy will foster open and respectful communication with peers. I
            am confident that these strengths will guide me successfully through
            my learning journey.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
            development. How might these affect your learning journey
          </h3>
          <p>
            One limitation I recognise in myself is my tendency towards
            perfectionism. While this drives me to produce high-quality work, it
            can sometimes lead to spending too much time on a task, trying to
            get it "just right." This perfectionism could potentially slow down
            my learning pace, especially when faced with complex subjects that
            present a steep learning curve, like learning JavaScript and
            JavaScript Frameworks, which is entirely new to me.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
            others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
            tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on
            what other strategies you would try now and why.
          </h3>
          <p>
            At my job as a web designer, I had issues with a copywriter who was
            always late with their work, making it really hard to meet
            deadlines. They would give me the text for the website just a day
            before the project was due, leaving no time to properly test
            everything and make necessary changes.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the time, I tried to fix this by often reminding them of the
            deadlines and starting on other parts of the website that didn't
            need the text. But this didn't work well, and we ended up rushing at
            the end, which affected the quality of our work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking back, a better approach would have been to have a meeting at
            the start to plan out when each part of the project would be done,
            with clear deadlines for both of us. Next time, I'd set up a meeting
            at the beginning to make a clear plan and have regular check-ins to
            see how things are going. This way, everyone knows what they need to
            do and when, helping us work together more smoothly and avoid
            last-minute rushes.
