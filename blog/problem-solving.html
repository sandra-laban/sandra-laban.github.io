          <h3>Blocked on a simple problem</h3>
          <p>
            I was working through a JavaScript Kata and got stuck on the
            gradebook piece. I got to the part where we need to complete the
            average function that returns the average of a given array of
            numbers - function average(arr){}. I thought the function needed to
            return the average of a particular student's test scores. I spent
            around an hour trying to pass that test, and I wasn't sure what was
            wrong. I was trying to check if the student's name exists in the
            grade book, then I got the test scores array for the student, and
            then I tried to manipulate the test scores to get the average
            number. Most of the time, I use Google to find the solution to the
            problem. Until I decided to use the "rubber duck" method and read
            out loud the instructions for the average function. Then, I realized
            the average function is a utility function that I will call in the
            next function, getAverage(studentName){}. So, the problem is solved!
          </p>
          <h3>Elegantly solved a problem</h3>
          <p>
            While working on the built-in methods, the function concatMyArray
            was pretty straightforward, and we had already used those methods. I
            thought it was going to work, but it didn't! I got the space between
            the words - zoom zoom ! The second attempt was removing the space
            here, .join(' '), to .join(''). And that was it - it works
            perfectly! - zoomzoom!
          </p>
          <h3>Problem solving techniques</h3>
          <p>
            I feel confident with most of that, aside from asking for help on
            Discord or writing pseudocode. It is challenging to put my thoughts
            into clear steps in pseudocode. It's a work in progress for me, and
            it's definitely something I need to improve. Reading console errors
            is a great way to check if you've made some syntax errors and to
            check the output. I used this most of the time, as well as Google
            search. The "rubber duck" method also helped, especially when trying
            to understand the question or problem.
          </p>
          <h3>Asking for help</h3>
          <p>
            I was trying to solve it all by myself first because there must be a
            solution somewhere - we are not trying to invent the hot water or
            the wheel. So, it did take a bit longer than if I had asked for help
            in Discord, but I was hesitant to reach out for help. Also, there
            are already posts from others, so I was glad I didn't need to ask
            for the same thing.
